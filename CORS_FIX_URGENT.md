# URGENT FIX - CORS Blocking Extension API Calls

## Date: 2025-10-23

## Problem Report

User reported zero insights appearing in UI with CORS errors in console:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://live-assistant-2.preview.emergentagent.com/api/generate-insight' 
from origin 'chrome-extension://...' has been blocked by CORS policy: 
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
```

Multiple [AI:FETCH:FAILED] errors with "Failed to fetch"

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: CORS Middleware Order
**Problem:** CORS middleware was added AFTER the router was included in the app
```python
# WRONG ORDER (Line 336-344)
app.include_router(api_router)
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)  # Too late!
```

**Why it matters:** FastAPI processes middleware in reverse order of addition. CORS must be added BEFORE routes are included so it can intercept OPTIONS preflight requests.

### Issue 2: Missing Dependency
**Problem:** `distro` module not installed - required by Anthropic library
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distro'
```

**Why it matters:** Backend couldn't start, so ALL API calls failed

## Solutions Applied

### Fix 1: Move CORS Middleware (CRITICAL)

**File:** `/app/backend/server.py`

**Before (Lines 26-29):**
```python
app = FastAPI()
api_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api")
```

**After (Lines 26-38):**
```python
app = FastAPI()

# ==================== CORS CONFIGURATION ====================
# CRITICAL: Must be configured BEFORE including routers
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins including Chrome extensions
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
# ===========================================================

api_router = APIRouter(prefix="/api")
```

**Removed duplicate (Lines 338-344):**
```python
# DELETED - was causing middleware to be added too late
app.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, ...)
```

### Fix 2: Install Missing Dependency

**Installed:**
```bash
pip install distro
```

**Added to requirements.txt:**
```
distro>=1.9.0
```

## Verification

### Backend Logs Confirm Success:
```
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     10.64.136.205:42480 - "OPTIONS /api/generate-insight HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     10.64.130.103:57372 - "POST /api/generate-insight HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
2025-10-23 01:25:29,963 - server - INFO - ðŸ¤– Generating insight for delta: 3
2025-10-23 01:25:29,963 - server - INFO - ðŸ¤– Calling Claude Sonnet 4.5 with your API key...
```

âœ… OPTIONS (preflight) = 200 OK  
âœ… POST (insight request) = 200 OK  
âœ… Backend processing Claude calls  

## Testing Instructions

1. **Reload Chrome Extension:**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click reload on Spikely
   
2. **Open TikTok Live stream**

3. **Start audio capture**

4. **Check console for:**
   - âœ… NO CORS errors
   - âœ… "CLAUDE INSIGHT RECEIVED" logs
   - âœ… "USING CLAUDE INSIGHT" logs
   
5. **Verify blue card shows insights:**
   - Format: "Ask about X. Stay hyped"
   - NOT: CORS errors or "Failed to fetch"

## Expected Behavior Now

### Success Flow:
1. Extension triggers insight (delta or timer)
2. Browser sends OPTIONS preflight â†’ Backend returns 200 with CORS headers
3. Browser sends POST with insight data â†’ Backend processes with Claude
4. Backend returns Claude insight â†’ Extension displays in UI

### Console Logs:
```
âœ… CLAUDE INSIGHT RECEIVED (Extension)
âœ… Response Time: 450 ms
âœ… Emotional Label: Ask about their gaming setup
âœ… Next Move: Stay hyped
âœ… USING CLAUDE INSIGHT (Quality-Only Mode)
```

## Why This Broke

**Likely timeline:**
1. Version 020/021 changes didn't touch backend
2. But backend server.py had CORS middleware in wrong position all along
3. Previous versions may have worked due to:
   - Browser caching of OPTIONS responses
   - Different CORS policy enforcement
   - Backend restart cleared some cached state

**The bug was latent** - existed before but not triggered until recent deployment

## Files Modified

1. `/app/backend/server.py`
   - Moved CORS middleware to line 29 (before router)
   - Removed duplicate CORS at line 338
   
2. `/app/backend/requirements.txt`
   - Added `distro>=1.9.0`

## Prevention for Future

1. **Always add CORS middleware first** in FastAPI apps
2. **Test CORS explicitly** when deploying API changes
3. **Monitor backend startup logs** for import errors
4. **Add distro to initial requirements** for Anthropic projects

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:
1. Check backend status: `sudo supervisorctl status backend`
2. Check backend logs: `tail -n 100 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log`
3. Verify CORS: `curl -v https://live-assistant-2.preview.emergentagent.com/api/generate-insight`

## Status

âœ… **FIXED** - Backend running, CORS working, insights flowing

**Next:** User should reload extension and test
