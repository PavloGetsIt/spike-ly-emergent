## Test 1: tabCapture (Primary Method)

### Steps
1. Open livestream tab with audio playing
2. Open Spikely side panel
3. Click "Start Audio" button

### Expected Console Output
```
[Spikely] Attempting tabCapture()
[Audio Capture] Starting capture for tab <tabId>
[Audio Capture] Creating offscreen document...
[Audio Capture] ‚úÖ Offscreen document created
[Audio Capture] Requesting media stream ID for tab: <tabId>
[Audio Capture] ‚úÖ Got stream ID: <streamId>
[Offscreen] Starting audio capture with stream ID: <streamId>
[Offscreen] ‚úÖ Media stream obtained
[Offscreen] Audio settings: {"sampleRate":48000,"channelCount":2,...}
[Offscreen] Connecting to Deepgram: wss://...
[Offscreen] ‚úÖ Connected to Deepgram
[Spikely] Token response status: 200
[Spikely] WebSocket open
[Spikely] Sent audio frames: <count>
[Offscreen] üìù FINAL: <transcript text>
```

### Expected UI Behavior
- Button changes from "Start Audio" ‚Üí "Starting..." ‚Üí "Stop Audio"
- Audio indicator pulses when audio detected
- Transcript lines appear in panel
- No error messages in console

### Pass Criteria
‚úÖ No "Extension has not been invoked" error  
‚úÖ Audio tracks detected: 1 or more  
‚úÖ WebSocket connects and stays open  
‚úÖ Frames sent counter increments  
‚úÖ Transcripts appear within 2-3 seconds  

---

## Test 2: getDisplayMedia Fallback

### Steps
1. Open livestream tab
2. Open side panel
3. Click "Start Audio"
4. If tabCapture fails ‚Üí confirm fallback prompt
5. In share dialog:
   - Select the livestream tab
   - ‚úÖ Check "Share tab audio"
   - Click "Share"

### Expected Console Output
```
[Spikely] tabCapture lastError: <error message>
[Spikely] getDisplayMedia fallback invoked
[Spikely Side Panel] Attempting getDisplayMedia fallback
[Spikely Side Panel] ‚úÖ getDisplayMedia succeeded
[Spikely Side Panel] Stream audio tracks: 1
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Initializing audio processor...
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Audio tracks: 1
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Audio settings: {"sampleRate":48000,"channelCount":1,...}
[Spikely AudioProcessor] AudioContext created: sampleRate=24000Hz
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Connecting WebSocket: <url>
[Spikely AudioProcessor] ‚úÖ WebSocket connected
[Spikely AudioProcessor] ‚úÖ Using AudioWorklet (preferred)
[Spikely AudioProcessor] ‚úÖ Audio processing started
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Sent 100 audio frames
[Spikely AudioProcessor] üìù Transcript: "<text>"
```

### Expected UI Behavior
- Fallback prompt appears with clear instructions
- Browser's screen share dialog shows
- After selecting tab + audio: button shows "Stop Audio"
- Transcripts appear normally

### Pass Criteria
‚úÖ Fallback prompt is clear and helpful  
‚úÖ Stream has audio tracks after selection  
‚úÖ Processing starts without errors  
‚úÖ Transcripts work same as tabCapture  

---

## Test 3: Token Security

### Steps
1. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Start audio capture
3. Inspect WebSocket connections
4. Check all XHR/Fetch requests

### Expected
- **Token fetch**: POST to `/functions/v1/realtime-token` returns 200
- **WebSocket**: Connects to Lovable function relay (not direct to provider)
- **NO API keys** visible in:
  - Request headers
  - URL parameters  
  - WebSocket frames
  - JavaScript bundles

### Pass Criteria
‚úÖ Token endpoint returns: `{status:"ok", provider:"deepgram", ...}`  
‚úÖ No `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` or similar in client code  
‚úÖ WebSocket URL goes through Lovable relay  

---

## Test 4: Error Recovery

### Test 4a: No Audio in Stream
1. Open a silent tab (no audio playing)
2. Try to start audio capture

Expected: Clear error message or warning that audio is required

### Test 4b: Deny getDisplayMedia
1. Trigger fallback
2. Click "Cancel" in share dialog

Expected: 
- Alert: "Screen sharing was cancelled"
- Button returns to "Start Audio"

### Test 4c: Token Fetch Fails
1. Temporarily break edge function or remove API key
2. Try to start capture

Expected:
```
[Spikely] Token response status: 500, body: <error>
[Spikely] Token fetch failed ‚Äî see server logs
```
- WebSocket should NOT attempt to connect
- Error message shown to user

### Test 4d: WebSocket Disconnects Mid-Stream
1. Start capture successfully
2. Simulate network interruption or close relay

Expected:
- Console shows: "WebSocket closed: code=<code>"
- Reconnection attempts logged
- Eventually shows error if max attempts exceeded

---

## Test 5: Performance & Stability

### Steps
1. Start audio capture
2. Let run for 5 minutes
3. Monitor console for:
   - Frame count incrementing steadily
   - No memory leaks
   - Keepalive messages every ~25s

### Expected Console (sampled)
```
[Offscreen] Sent 100 audio frames
[Offscreen] üíì Keepalive sent
[Offscreen] Sent 200 audio frames
[Offscreen] üìù FINAL: <transcript>
[Offscreen] Sent 300 audio frames
```

### Pass Criteria
‚úÖ Frame counter increases continuously  
‚úÖ No console errors or warnings  
‚úÖ Keepalive messages appear  
‚úÖ Memory usage stable (check Task Manager)  
‚úÖ Transcripts appear for all speech  

---

## Test 6: Multi-Platform

Test on each platform:
- ‚úÖ TikTok Live
- ‚úÖ YouTube Live
- ‚úÖ Twitch
- ‚úÖ Kick

Expected: Same behavior across all platforms

---

## Test 7: Stop & Restart

### Steps
1. Start audio capture
2. Wait for transcripts
3. Click "Stop Audio"
4. Wait 5 seconds
5. Click "Start Audio" again

### Expected
- Clean stop: all connections closed
- Restart works same as initial start
- No lingering connections or errors

---

## Debug Checklist (printed to console at start)

When audio capture starts, should see:

```
[Spikely AudioProcessor] === AUDIO CAPTURE DEBUG CHECKLIST ===
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Audio tracks: 1
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Settings: sampleRate=48000, channelCount=1, deviceId=<id>
[Spikely AudioProcessor] AudioContext: sampleRate=24000Hz, state=running
[Spikely AudioProcessor] WebSocket: state=OPEN
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Frames sent: 0
[Spikely AudioProcessor] Processing: YES
[Spikely AudioProcessor] =====================================
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Extension has not been invoked"
**Cause**: tabCapture called without user gesture or wrong context  
**Solution**: Ensure capture is triggered from background.js, not content script

### Issue: No audio tracks in stream
**Cause**: User didn't check "Share tab audio" in getDisplayMedia  
**Solution**: Show clearer instructions in fallback prompt

### Issue: Token fetch fails
**Cause**: API key not set in Supabase  
**Solution**: Add DEEPGRAM_API_KEY secret

### Issue: WebSocket closes immediately
**Cause**: Invalid token or relay misconfigured  
**Solution**: Check edge function logs

---

## Final Acceptance

All tests must pass for acceptance:

- [x] Test 1: tabCapture works without errors
- [x] Test 2: Fallback to getDisplayMedia works
- [x] Test 3: No API keys exposed to client
- [x] Test 4a-d: All error cases handled gracefully
- [x] Test 5: Stable for 5+ minutes
- [x] Test 6: Works on all platforms
- [x] Test 7: Stop/restart clean

---

## Production Readiness

Before deploying:

1. ‚úÖ Set `debugEnabled = false` in audioProcessor.js for production
2. ‚úÖ Verify all API keys stored securely in Supabase secrets
3. ‚úÖ Test on clean browser profile
4. ‚úÖ Test with multiple concurrent tabs
5. ‚úÖ Load test edge functions
6. ‚úÖ Document for users: permissions needed, fallback instructions
