# 🚨 URGENT FIX: Content Script Not Injecting

## ✅ Problem Identified

**Root Cause:** Content script patterns in manifest.json were too restrictive and Chrome wasn't matching the TikTok URL.

**Evidence:**
- `window.__SPIKELY_CONTENT_ACTIVE__` returns `undefined`
- No content script logs in console
- Background script runs (you see errors from it)
- Content script file exists and has no syntax errors

## 🔧 Fix Applied

Changed manifest.json content_scripts from:
```json
"matches": [
  "*://*.tiktok.com/*/live*",    // Too restrictive
  "*://*.tiktok.com/@*/live*"    // Pattern matching issues
]
```

To:
```json
"matches": [
  "*://*.tiktok.com/*",          // Match ALL TikTok pages
  "*://tiktok.com/*"             // Without www subdomain too
]
```

Version bumped: 2.2.0 → 2.2.1

## 🚀 ACTION REQUIRED: Follow These Steps EXACTLY

### Step 1: Reload Extension
1. Go to: `chrome://extensions`
2. Find "Spikely"
3. Click the **RELOAD** button (circular arrow)
4. Verify version shows **2.2.1**

### Step 2: Close ALL TikTok Tabs
**CRITICAL:** You must close EVERY TikTok tab
- Chrome caches the old content script
- New version won't inject until tabs are closed

### Step 3: Open Fresh TikTok Live Tab
Go to: https://www.tiktok.com/@yourlittlebuttercupx/live

### Step 4: Check Console IMMEDIATELY
Press F12 → Console tab

**You MUST see these logs NOW:**
```
🚀🚀🚀 [SPIKELY] CONTENT SCRIPT LOADING... 🚀🚀🚀
[SPIKELY] URL: https://www.tiktok.com/@yourlittlebuttercupx/live
[Spikely] ✅ Marking script as active
🎉🎉🎉 [SPIKELY] CONTENT SCRIPT FULLY LOADED! 🎉🎉🎉
[Spikely] Platform detected: tiktok
```

### Step 5: Verify Content Script Loaded
Type in console:
```javascript
window.__SPIKELY_CONTENT_ACTIVE__
```

**Should return:** `true` ✅

### Step 6: Test Functions
```javascript
window.__SPIKELY_TEST__()
window.__SPIKELY_TEST_CHAT__()
```

Both should execute without errors.

## ❓ What If It Still Doesn't Work?

### Check #1: Extension Permissions
1. Go to chrome://extensions
2. Click "Details" on Spikely
3. Scroll to "Site access"
4. Should say: **"On all sites"** or **"On specific sites"**
5. If it says "On click" → Change it to "On all sites"

### Check #2: Verify File Loaded
1. F12 → Sources tab
2. Expand: Content scripts → Spikely
3. You should see: content.js listed

### Check #3: Hard Reset
If still not working:
1. chrome://extensions
2. Click "Remove" on Spikely
3. Reload the extension (Load unpacked)
4. Close all tabs
5. Open fresh TikTok Live tab

## 🎯 Expected Result

**After following these steps, you should see:**

✅ Content script logs in console  
✅ `window.__SPIKELY_CONTENT_ACTIVE__ === true`  
✅ Test functions work  
✅ Viewer detection starts  
✅ Chat detection starts  

**Background errors you see are separate issues** (Hume AI connection) but won't prevent content script from loading.

## 📋 Report Back

After following the steps, please confirm:

1. **Version number:** chrome://extensions shows 2.2.1?
2. **Console logs:** Do you see the 🚀🚀🚀 messages?
3. **Content script active:** `window.__SPIKELY_CONTENT_ACTIVE__` returns true?
4. **Sources tab:** content.js visible under Content scripts?

If ANY of these fail, report which step failed and I'll help debug further.
